We define two types of actors relevant to the scheduling process: Scheduling Client and Scheduling Server.

#### Scheduling Client
The [Scheduling Client](ActorDefinition-at-scheduling-actor-scheduling-client.html) requests data relevant to appointment scheduling (Healthcare Service Providers, Healthcare Services, available time slots, etc.) using parameters from a Scheduling Server and books/edits/cancels appointments for a specific patient.

#### Scheduling Server
A [Scheduling Server](ActorDefinition-at-scheduling-actor-scheduling-server.html) serves data relevant to appointment scheduling (Healthcare Service Providers, Healthcare Services, available time slots, etc.) and provides services such as: creating patients, booking/editing/cancelling appointments.
