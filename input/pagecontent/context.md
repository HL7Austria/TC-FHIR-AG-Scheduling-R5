#### Schedule
The schedule resource provides a container for (time)-slots that can be booked using an appointment. One schedule applies to one service or resource that can be booked and contains multiple slots indicating the availability of this service/resource. A real-world analogue of a schedule is a calendar column (for a single resource or service). For a more detailed description, refer to [Schedule](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/schedule.html).

#### Slot
The slot is one unit of time on a schedule and represents the smallest unit of time that the service or resource can be booked for. A real-world analogue of a slot would be the rows in a calendar column. For a more detailed description, refer to [Slot](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/slot.html).
