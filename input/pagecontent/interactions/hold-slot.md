In this optional step, a [Slot](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-slot.html) can be requested to be put on hold (i.e. reserved) by a Scheduling Client until the Appointment is booked. [$hold](OperationDefinition-slot-hold.html) is the corresponding operation definition. The Slot is identified either by a Reference or one or more Identifiers, which have to identify a single slot instance. For creating a hold on an Appointment, the parameter `slot-status` SHALL have value `busy-tentative`. For releasing the hold on a previously reserved Slot, `slot-status` SHALL have value `free`. The response contains the Slot resource and an OperationOutcome. In case of successfull creation of the hold, the `status` of the Slot is set to "busy-tentative" and the response SHALL contain a parameter `held-until` with type dateTime, signaling, when the hold expires automatically. The Scheduling Server decides how long a Slot is held. If the Slot was successfully released, the `status` is set to `free`. If the hold operation is rejected, due to another Scheduling Client consuming the Slot by booking an Appointment or creating a hold on the Slot, the `status` of the Slot is set to "busy-unavailable".
