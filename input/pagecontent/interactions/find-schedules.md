After (optional) selection of a HealthcareSerice a Schedulung Client can fetch available Schedules. The schedule resource provides a container for (time)-slots that can be booked using an appointment. One schedule applies to one service or resource that can be booked and contains multiple slots indicating the availability of this service/resource. A real-world analogue of a schedule is a calendar column (for a single resource or service). For a more detailed description, refer to [Schedule](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/schedule.html). [Search parameters](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-schedule.html#search-parameters) of the [HL7Â® AT Scheduling Schedule Profile](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-schedule.html) can be used to filter the results. If no search filter for the `active` attribute is provided, the Scheduling Server SHALL respond with resources where the value of the `active` attribute is `true` or not present.
