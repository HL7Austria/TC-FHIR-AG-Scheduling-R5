After (optional) selection of a HealthcareSerice a Schedulung Client can fetch available Schedules. A schedule is a container for Slots, which is often displayed as a calendar in Software into which appointments can be booked. [Search parameters](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-schedule.html#search-parameters) of the [HL7Â® AT Scheduling Schedule Profile](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-schedule.html) can be used to filter the results. If no search filter for the `active` attribute is provided, the Scheduling Server SHALL respond with resources where the value of the `active` attribute is `true` or not present.
