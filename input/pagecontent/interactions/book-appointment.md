The scheduling client books an appointment by sending an [HL7Â® AT Scheduling Appointment Profile](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-appointment.html) resource with `status` "proposed" to the Scheduling Server. The Scheduling Server returns a [Parameters](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/parameters.html) response containing the requested Appointment and an [OperationOutcome](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/operationoutcome.html). The Appointment resource will have an updated status of `booked` if the request is approved or "cancelled" if it is rejected. The corresponding operation definition is the [$book](OperationDefinition-appointment-book.html) operation.
