A Scheduling Client can create a Patient on a Scheduling Server. This is a prerequisite for booking an Appointment in which this Patient participates. The [HL7Â® AT Core Patient Profile](https://fhir.hl7.at/HL7-AT-FHIR-Core-R5/StructureDefinition-at-core-patient.html) SHALL be used by both the Scheduling Client for the request as well as the Scheduling Server in the response.
