After selecting one or more Schedules, available Slots for this/those Schedules can be fetched. Each of those Slots represents a time slot for which an Appointment can be booked.[Search parameters](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-slot.html#search-parameters) of the [HL7Â® AT Scheduling Slot Profile](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-slot.html) can be used to filter the results.

ToDo: How are slots for video calls marked? Only implicitly via HealthcareService?
