After selecting one or more Schedules, available Slots for this/those Schedules can be fetched. The slot is one unit of time on a schedule and represents the smallest unit of time that the service or resource can be booked for. A real-world analogue of a slot would be the rows in a calendar column. For a more detailed description, refer to [Slot](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/slot.html). [Search parameters](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-slot.html#search-parameters) of the [HL7Â® AT Scheduling Slot Profile](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-slot.html) can be used to filter the results.
