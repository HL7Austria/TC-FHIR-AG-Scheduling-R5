A Scheduling Client can fetch bookable HealthcareServices from a Scheduling Server. [Search parameters](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-healthcareservice.html#search-parameters) of the [HL7Â® AT Scheduling HealthcareService Profile](StructureDefinition-at-scheduling-healthcareservice.html) can be used to filter the results. If no search filter for the `active` attribute is provided, the Scheduling Server SHALL respond with resources where the value of the `active` attribute is `true` or not present.
